# Card Game Test
Catchy name. This is a repo for me to host card game ideas I want to playtest with people over the internet. Right now it is pretty much where I would like it to be but here is a list of possible things I could do in the future:
- Make it actually multiplayer, with a server and all O_O
- Show the oponents hand even if it is just hidden
- Make the UI nicer with images and all
